# Beginner-Problem_NUMER-GUESSING
Oh no! It seems that my code keeps generating a new number every time you guess and don't guess correctly. Beginner, maybe you can help me?
Locate the issue and replace it with working code.
Once done, you can review the code, make it more efficient, and continue learning!
